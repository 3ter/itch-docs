# Using itch offline

It is possible to use the itch app offline. If you've logged in at least
once successfully before, you'll be able to pick which session to identify
as.

If you just lose your network access while the app is running, it'll keep
launching games, showing your collections, and searching your local library.

*Note: when offline, the main search bar won't display online results
for reasons that are hopefully self-explanatory.*
