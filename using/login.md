# Logging in

The first time the app starts, it will ask you for your itch.io username \(or e-mail\)  
and password.

_Note: It is not possible to use the app anonymously at the moment, although downloading  
or even purchasing is possible on the _[https://itch.io](https://itch.io)_ website without an account._

## Captcha

If we are currently under 

## Two-factor authentication

Currently, even if you have two-factor authentication enabled, the app won't ask  
for it in the login screen. Logging in through the app doesn't give access to your  
full account, it only allows to list your collections and download games you've  
bought.

The web log-in is currently separate, see 'App log-in vs web-login' underneath.

## Multiple sessions

You can log in with multiple user accounts from the itch app. Each session  
has its own set of browser tabs, has access to its own creations, etc.

There is one thing that's shared between all sessions connected on the same  
itch app: all sessions are able to launch installed games \(but may not be  
able to update them\).
