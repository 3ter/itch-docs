# Install locations

Install locations are folders that the itch app installs games to. The initial install location is in a folder your user has write access to without requiring administrator rights.

_That's why games aren't installed to _`Program Files`_ on Windows. As a rule, the app can be installed and used without ever asking for Administrator privileges, except for _[_sandbox setup_](sandbox.md)_ or third-party installers._

## Changing the default install location

To change the location games are installed to, add a new one by clicking the **Add location** button, then click on the hamburger menu and pick **Make default**.

This menu also lets you remove an install location, or open it in a tab to see which games are installed:
