# Installing itch

You can download the latest version of the app from <https://itch.io/app>.
The download button leads to a page that will attempt to detect your current platform
and redirect you to the appropriate download.

Additionally, there are .deb and .rpm repositories, and AUR packages that
you might miss out on if you rely on the main download page. To learn more about these,
please refer to the following pages:

  * [Installing on Windows](windows.md)
  * [Installing on macOS](macos.md)
  * [Installing on Linux](linux/README.md)

Release notes for all versions are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/itchio/itch/releases).

## Upgrading itch

On macOS and Windows, the app automatically updates itself, notifying you when
it's ready to be restarted, with a list of changes:

On Linux, you currently have to download and install a newer package yourself,
except if you're using our .deb or .rpm repository, although we are [working
on an alternative](https://github.com/fasterthanlime/Marmot.Linux)

You can check the currently running version of the app by hovering the `itch`
logo in the top-left corner, or by opening the user menu (bottom-left). Older
versions of the app only show it in the `Help` menu, which you can make appear
by pressing the Alt key, on platforms where it's hidden by default.
