# Installing itch on ArchLinux

There is an AUR package available to install itch:

* [https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/itch/](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/itch/)

It is a best-effort package that may lag slightly behind official releases.

The [AUR page](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/itch/) is also the right place to discuss ArchLinux-specific itch problems.
