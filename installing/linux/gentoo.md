# Installing itch on Gentoo

At the time of this writing, there is no PKGBUILD available for itch in
any overlay, that we know of.

However, I (Amos) hold a special place in my heart for Gentoo, having used it
for several years during my college days, and although I don't have the time
to maintain one, if someone feels like maintaining a PKGBUILD for itch, I would
be happy to provide support.

If you're interested, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/itchio/itch/issues/new)
to start a discussion!

## Git installation

We ship portable archives of itch at <https://github.com/itchio/itch/releases>
which you should be able to unpack and run without much trouble, provided
you have the few X and gtk libraries required.

Alternatively, you can always follow the [Getting started](developing/getting-started.md) guide to run it as if in dev.
