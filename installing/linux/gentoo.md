# Installing itch on Gentoo

At the time of this writing, there is no PKGBUILD available for itch in any overlay that we know of.

## Git installation

We ship portable archives of itch at [https://github.com/itchio/itch/releases](https://github.com/itchio/itch/releases) which you should be able to unpack and run without much trouble, provided you have the few X and gtk libraries required.

Alternatively, you can always follow the [Getting started](developing/getting-started.md) guide to run it as if in dev.
