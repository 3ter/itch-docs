# Installing on Linux

Various Linux distributions have varying opinions on how software should be distributed â€” this makes Linux a particularly hard platform to target, given the sheer number of different format to support.

We maintain the following packages:

* [.deb repository](ubuntu-and-debian.md) \(Ubuntu, Debian, etc.\)
* [.rpm repository](fedora.md) \(Fedora, etc.\)
* [AUR package](archlinux.md) \(ArchLinux\)
* [Gentoo & others](gentoo.md)
