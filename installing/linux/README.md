# Installing on Linux

Various Linux distributions have varying opinions on how software should be
distributed â€” this makes Linux a particularly hard platform to target, given
the sheer number of different format to support.

Some vendors ship a self-updater in their app, which is a valid choice, but
we've opted for following the official package manager for each Linux
distribution:

  * [.deb repository](ubuntu-and-debian.md) (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)
  * [.rpm repository](fedora.md) (Fedora, etc.)
  * [AUR package](archlinux.md) (ArchLinux)
  * [Gentoo & others](gentoo.md)
